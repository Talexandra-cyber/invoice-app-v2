# CBT & Mindfulness Coping Strategies

- **Strategy for feeling nervous/anxious:** When you feel that anxious energy, try the '5-4-3-2-1' grounding technique. Look around and name 5 things you can see, 4 things you can touch, 3 things you can hear, 2 things you can smell, and 1 thing you can taste. This pulls your focus back to the present moment.

- **Strategy for uncontrollable worrying:** Try scheduling a 'worry time'. Set aside 15 minutes each day to let yourself worry about everything on your mind. When a worry pops up outside that time, jot it down and tell yourself you'll deal with it during your scheduled time.

- **Strategy for worrying about different things:** When your mind is racing with different worries, grab a piece of paper and do a 'brain dump'. Write down every single thing you're worried about, big or small. Often, just getting them out of your head and onto paper can make them feel more manageable.

- **Strategy for trouble relaxing:** Try 'progressive muscle relaxation'. Starting with your toes, tense a muscle group for five seconds, then release it for thirty seconds. Work your way up your body. This physical release can lead to mental relaxation.

- **Strategy for restlessness:** Channel that restless energy into a simple, repetitive physical activity. This could be walking around the room, tidying up a small space, or stretching. Giving the energy a purpose can help it dissipate.

- **Strategy for being annoyed/irritable:** When you feel irritation rising, focus on your breath. Take a slow, deep breath in through your nose for four counts, hold it for four counts, and exhale slowly through your mouth for six counts. Repeat this a few times to calm your nervous system.

- **Strategy for feeling afraid:** When you feel that sense of dread, gently challenge the thought. Ask yourself: 'What is the evidence for this awful thing happening? What is a more likely outcome?' This technique, called cognitive restructuring, can help break the cycle of catastrophic thinking.
