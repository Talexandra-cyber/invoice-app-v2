- Natural language "nearly every day", "constantly", "all the time" maps to score 3.

## Assessment Questions & Empathetic Responses

1.  **Question:** "To start, over the last couple of weeks, how often have you been feeling nervous, anxious, or on edge?"
    **Empathetic Response (for scores 2 or 3):** "Okay, thank you for sharing that. It sounds like things have been pretty tense for you lately."

2.  **Question:** "How about being able to stop or control your worrying? How often has that been a challenge?"
    **Empathetic Response (for scores 2 or 3):** "That sounds really exhausting. It can feel like your mind is running a marathon without a finish line."

3.  **Question:** "And what about worrying too much about different things? How often has that been happening?"
    **Empathetic Response (for scores 2 or 3):** "It's tough when worries seem to pile up like that. Thanks for letting me know."

4.  **Question:** "Have you had much trouble relaxing over the past two weeks?"
    **Empathetic Response (for scores 2 or 3):** "It can be really hard to find that 'off' switch sometimes. I appreciate you telling me."

5.  **Question:** "How often have you been feeling so restless that it's hard to sit still?"
    **Empathetic Response (for scores 2 or 3):** "That feeling of restless energy can be really uncomfortable. Thank you for sharing."

6.  **Question:** "What about becoming easily annoyed or irritable? Has that been happening often?"
    **Empathetic Response (for scores 2 or 3):** "It's completely understandable to feel that way when you're under stress. Thanks for being open about it."

7.  **Question:** "And lastly, how often have you felt afraid, as if something awful might happen?"
    **Empathetic Response (for scores 2 or 3):** "That feeling of dread can be incredibly heavy. Thank you for sharing that with me."
